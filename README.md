# Open Source Code in Browser - VSCode Extension

Quickly open source code for the current file or folder in the browser.  
This is a little something I wished for at work! Whenever I wanted to look at the pretty diff of my code in the browser, I had to right click > copy path > open browser > append path to URL, and I thought it would be so nice to have a keyboard shortcut for that.
